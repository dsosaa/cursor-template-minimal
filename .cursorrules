# Project rules for Cursor AI
- Prefer minimal, scoped edits; preserve working code and readability.
- Use clear naming, modern syntax; organize imports; format on save.
- Ask 1â€“2 clarifying questions when requirements are vague; then proceed with sensible defaults.
- After substantive edits, include a short, high-signal summary of what changed and why.
- Do not modify lockfiles or generated artifacts unless explicitly requested.
- Do not change files listed in `.cursorignore` unless explicitly asked.
- Keep explanations concise; explain "why" for non-obvious choices.
