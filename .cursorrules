# Project Rules for Cursor AI

## Core Principles
- Prefer minimal, scoped edits; preserve working code and readability
- Use clear naming, modern syntax; organize imports; format on save
- Ask 1â€“2 clarifying questions when requirements are vague; then proceed with sensible defaults
- After substantive edits, include a short, high-signal summary of what changed and why
- Keep explanations concise; explain "why" for non-obvious choices

## File Management
- Do not modify lockfiles or generated artifacts unless explicitly requested
- Do not change files listed in `.cursorignore` unless explicitly asked
- Preserve existing code structure and patterns when making additions

## Documentation Integration
- Reference project docs using @docs/filename.md to understand context
- Update relevant documentation when making significant changes
- Use @docs/tasks.md to understand current priorities and context
- Follow patterns established in @docs/architecture.md for consistency

## Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Add comments only where non-obvious; explain "why," not "how"
- Follow established project patterns and conventions
- Ensure changes maintain or improve code readability

## Testing & Validation
- Suggest tests for non-trivial logic changes
- Validate changes align with project goals in @docs/project-overview.md
- Consider impact on existing functionality before making changes
